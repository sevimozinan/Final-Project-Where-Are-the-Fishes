# FINAL PROJECT Where Are the Fishes? 

My project of Statistical Analysis Softwares (Rstudio) at Marmara University

Exploring acoustic backscatter data to find fish in the US Atlantic Ocean. 

Reflections. No, I’m not talking about contemplating your existence within the Tidyverse or understanding what that spline did to your data. I’m talking about echoes. Specifically, acoustic echoes called “backscatter.” Marine scientists use acoustic backscatter to understand the distribution of organisms in the ocean.

In this analysis, together with Sevim Ozinan, Mehtap Fil and Yasemin Hizarci we discussed wrangle active acoustic data and plotted the mean volume backscatter associated with fish with swim-bladders in relation to bathymetry (depth of the seafloor)

These acoustic data were collected from a research vessel that crossed the shelf break in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (NOAA cruise HB1103) and were preprocessed using the software, Echoview.
